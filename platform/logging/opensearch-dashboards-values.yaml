# Configuration for the OpenSearch Dashboards (UI) component
# Note: The release name of the cluster is assumed to be 'opensearch-cluster'

opensearchHosts: "http://opensearch-cluster-data.opensearch.svc.cluster.local:9200"

# Resources (adjust for your cluster size)
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 256Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi

# Security Configuration (If your cluster requires internal mTLS or username/pass)
# If OpenSearch requires authentication, you must configure a secret mount here.
# For simplicity, we are assuming internal K8s traffic is authenticated via Istio mTLS.
